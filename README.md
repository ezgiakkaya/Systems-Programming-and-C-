# README.md for Zombie Apocalypse Simulation Project

🧟‍♂️🌍 Welcome to the Zombie Apocalypse Simulation Project! 🌍🧟‍♀️

This project is part of COMP 201 – Fall 2023 Assignment 2: Heap Management, focusing on creating a zero-player game that simulates a zombie apocalypse. The assignment was assigned on November 1, 2023, and completed by me, Ezgi Akkaya (KU ID: 79676). 🧑‍💻🧠

## Overview 📖

In the year 2045, a mysterious virus, the Zeta Strain, turns the world into chaos by reanimating the dead into zombies. In this project, we simulate the struggle of humanity to reach the safe haven of Eden amidst this apocalypse. 💀🌆

## Key Features 🌟

- Dynamic memory allocation for grid representation.
- Simulation of human and zombie movements with specific rules.
- Detection of human survival, zombie deaths, and human infections.
- Utilization of file input for grid initialization.
- Extensive use of pointers, arrays, and control structures in C.

## Simulation Rules 📜

1. **Humans and Zombies**: Humans move right then down, while zombies move right, down, left, and up.
2. **Zombie Death**: A zombie dies when surrounded by at least two humans.
3. **Human Infection**: A human turns into a zombie when caught alone by a zombie.
4. **Survival**: A human survives by reaching the bottom-right corner of the grid.

## How to Run 🚀

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/COMP201-Fall2023/assignment-2-EzgiAkkaya.git`
2. Compile: `gcc -std=gnu99 -g main.c -o main`
3. Execute: `./main <map_file.txt>`

## Learning Outcomes 🎓

Through this project, I enhanced my skills in:

- Dynamic memory management in C.
- Implementing complex algorithms and logic.
- Working with multi-dimensional arrays and pointers.
- Debugging and testing code for correctness.
- Using Git and GitHub for version control.

Hope you enjoy this simulation of the fierce battle between humans and zombies! May the best species win! 🏆🧟‍♂️🧑‍🔬
